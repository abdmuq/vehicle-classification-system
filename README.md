Introduction
This project focuses on developing a Vehicle Classification System utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to classify various types of vehicles accurately. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the project aims to contribute to advancements in the field of automated vehicle recognition, which has applications in traffic management, autonomous driving, and intelligent transportation systems.

Project Overview
The Vehicle Classification System is built to classify images of vehicles into different categories using a deep learning approach. The project includes the following key components:

Model Architecture: A carefully designed CNN model consisting of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected dense layers, optimized for vehicle image classification.
Data Management: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training and validation sets contain 10 classes of vehicle images, while the test set includes images from all classes collectively.
Frameworks and Tools: The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN, with Matplotlib for data visualization. The model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
Features
Accurate Vehicle Classification: The CNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying different types of vehicles.
Real-Time Classification: The system can classify vehicle images in real-time through an intuitive Streamlit interface.
Data Visualization: Provides visual insights into the dataset and model performance using Matplotlib.
Model Deployment: A user-friendly web application for deploying the model and making predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of vehicle images categorized into 10 classes. The data is split into three parts:

Training Set: Used to train the CNN model.
Validation Set: Used to validate and tune the model during training.
Test Set: Used to evaluate the final model performance.
Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: Extracts features from input images.
Pooling Layers: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Dense Layers: Performs classification based on the extracted features.
Dropout Layers: Used to prevent overfitting.
The model achieved an accuracy of 75%, with further potential for improvement through hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

Usage
Upload a vehicle image through the Streamlit interface.
The model processes the image and classifies it into one of the predefined vehicle categories.
The result is displayed on the web interface with the predicted vehicle type.
Future Work
Improving Model Accuracy: Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to enhance classification accuracy.
Expanding Dataset: Including more vehicle classes and images to improve the model's robustness.
Advanced Deployment: Integrating the model into mobile or embedded systems for wider application.
